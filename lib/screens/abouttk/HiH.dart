"We made our first video in fast mode and it literally looked like we were moving like snails it was so bad. We're definitely proud of how much we've improved and it's been fun trying new stuff!" Dani, 16, who performs with her 13-year-old-sister Deven, told Seventeen.com. 

These California-based sisters have 1.5 million fans on Musical.ly. 12-year-old Danielle Cohn agrees, having jumped into the app with zero experience before amassing 3.5 million fans. "My first Musical.ly was to Becky G's 'I Can't Stop Dancing," she said. "I do look back at it and cringe because I was so little and dancing and really didn't know what I was doing. But I'm so proud of myself for how much I have grown. I can move the camera so much better then before."

"We usually aren't able to hold the phone ourselves like most Musers do because we dance a lot, but we have a stand we set up which makes it a lot easier," Dani shared. "We also get our friends in it or they'll help film, and it makes it fun for all of us! Be sure to practice and have fun with the beat. Learning the rhythm is important whether you're dancing or lip syncing."

Maryland-based Musers Lucas and Marcus swear that where you shoot is one of the most important factors in making stand-out videos. "Finding an awesome location is important. It has to be in a lively, colorful, environment," they shared in an email. "You want it to be unique and a rare spot."

Using trending hashtags and songs gives you the chance to have more users discover your fledgling profile. "Our most-liked video is us dancing to the song 'Juju on that Beat," the twins added. "We knew it would be be our fans' favorite because not only did we film it at the grocery store, but everyone was dancing to it. It was a very popular trend." 

Up-and-coming Muser Morgan Monrad had similar success thanks to a viral challenge. "My most liked video that isn't featured is my #mirrorchallenge one," the 16-year-old shared. "I didn't even have many fans at the time, but I posted on a trending hashtag before it became a thing and because I was at the top everyone saw it."

Don't feel like you have to live with your videos forever. "I deleted my first ever Musical.ly because it was so bad," Morgan explained. "In fact, I deleted all my videos filmed on my old iPad because I couldn't stand the quality of them. I view all my videos regularly and delete the ones I think aren't good enough." Plus, Morgan swears she never posts her first take because "there's always room for improvement."

Danielle Cohn noticed that different types of videos have different advantages. "I get more likes when I post songs, but I get featured more with my comedy videos," she explained.

"Canadian muser Kristen figured out that timing really counts. "Try to post between the hours of 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. I've noticed this is when people are most active on Musical.ly and more people will see your videos. Posting at least twice a day is ideal if you want to gain fast, but I post more since the more you post, the more likely your videos will be seen." 

Dani and Deven echo the importance of timing. "We usually try to post around 3:00 p.m. PST so people our age are out of school and can watch on both the West Coast and the East Coast," said Dani.

"The fist video that I ever posted would have to be (in my opinion) the most cringe-y video on Musical.ly â€” or the internet in general," Kristen shared. "It was a lip-sync to a Nicki Minaj song and for some odd reason it got featured! I'm super proud of how far I came since then, but ironically enough, that was the video that jump started everything!"

14-year-old Muser Loren Gray found that drawing on her real-life hobbies and preferences in vids attracted more fans with similar interests. "Be yourself! Some of my most liked videos are my Harley Quinn costume videos. They showcased a lot of personality, and Halloween was right around the corner when I posted. And who doesn't love Suicide Squad?" the Pennsylvania-based star shared. 

"Choose songs that suit you and that you enjoy," Loren continued. "If you enjoy comedy, make comedy videos. Make sure you're comfortable with your content and be creative.

14-year-old twins Lisa and Lena try to work as much spontaneity into their feed as possible. "Our most-liked video is one we did at a photo shoot," the duo shared in an email. "We filmed it really quickly during a short break. That one went through the roof â€“ maybe itÂ´s because it is very, very spontaneous and we had such a great time at the shoot."

14. KNOW YOUR LYRICS!

According to 13-year-old twins Max and Harvey, the worst thing you can do is copy everyone else. "You should really try your best to think outside the box and do something original instead of what everyone else is doing," they said in an email. "Make sure your Musical.ly is unique and interesting!" 

The brothers added that there's one rule of Musical.ly you absolutely cannot break: KNOW. YOUR. LYRICS. "Definitely make sure you know the words of the song you're lip syncing too!" they stressed. Because even if you're angles are rough and you picked the wrong video speed, at least you got your lyrics right! You know? '''),
